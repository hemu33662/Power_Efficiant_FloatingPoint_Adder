# Power_Efficiant_FloatingPoint_Adder
 Floating-point addition is a fundamental and basic operation in various applications of computer architecture, but it often consumes significant power, area, and delay. Optimizing the mantissa addition, a key component of floating-point addition, can lead to significant improvements.
 we propose a hybrid RCA-CLA mantissa adder that adds the mantissa in the single precision floating point format using both ripple carry adder (RCA) and carry look-ahead adder (CLA).


Pre-requisites
